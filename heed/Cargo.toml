[features]
# The `serde` feature makes some types serializable,
# like the `EnvOpenOptions` struct.
default = ["serde", "serde-bincode", "serde-json"]

# The #MDB_NOTLS flag is automatically set on Env opening and
# RoTxn implements the Send trait. This allows the user to move
# a RoTxn between threads as read transactions will no more use
# thread local storage and will tie reader locktable slots to
# #MDB_txn objects instead of to threads.
#
# According to the LMDB documentation, when this feature is not enabled:
# A thread can only use one transaction at a time, plus any child
# transactions. Each transaction belongs to one thread. [...]
# The #MDB_NOTLS flag changes this for read-only transactions.
#
# And a #MDB_BAD_RSLOT error will be thrown when multiple read
# transactions exists on the same thread
read-txn-no-tls = []

# Enable the serde en/decoders for bincode, serde_json, or rmp_serde

# Whether to tell LMDB to use POSIX semaphores during compilation
# (instead of the default, which are System V semaphores).
# POSIX semaphores are required for Apple's App Sandbox on iOS & macOS,
# and are possibly faster and more appropriate for single-process use.
# There are tradeoffs for both POSIX and SysV semaphores; which you
# should look into before enabling this feature. Also, see here:
# <https://github.com/LMDB/lmdb/blob/3947014aed7ffe39a79991fa7fb5b234da47ad1a/libraries/liblmdb/lmdb.h#L46-L69>
